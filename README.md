# Assembly Syntax Sythetiser
Or ASS for short. This tool enables one to create a simple assembler in mere minutes, along with its documentation.

# Getting started

***DISCLAIMER*** *: It has only been tested on Linux. It probably does not work in MacOS or in Windows.*

## Build and install

***INFO*** *: The following commands assume you are working in your home directory.*

Install the dependencies first, using `apt` or your prefered package manager.

```bash
sudo apt install bison flex texlive gcc make
```

Clone the repository.
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/elzaidir/ass.git
```

Then launch the configuration script. It will check for dependencies.
```bash
cd ~/ass
./configure
```

Build `ASS` with make.

```bash
cd ~/ass
make
```

You can also install it, but it is not required.

```bash
cd ~/ass
make install
```

## Building a basic assembler

Once `ASS` has been built you can generate an assembler C project from an example. Create a directory for your assembler project, this will contain the source file of the generated assembler. We then call `ASS`.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir myfirstassembler
ass -o myfirstassembler/ ass/examples/basic_assembler.ass
```

Then we can simply call `make` from the directory. The Makefile is automatically generated.

```bash
cd ~/myfirstassembler
make
```

If everything went well, you now have a `basic_assembler` executable in your project directory.

## Using the assembler

To assemble a file using our newly built assembler use :

```bash
cd ~/myfirstassembler
basic_assembler -o output.elf ../ass/examples/basic_assembler.asm
```

# Documentation

## ASS documentation

A syntax summary is available here : <https://github.com/elzaidir/ass/blob/master/doc/ass_syntax.md>

## Assembler documentation

You can generate the documentation of your assembler when generating it. It will add the description of your the different opcode formats, register configuration, sections and the built-in macros along with the syntax structure. It first generates a `.tex` file that is converted to a `.pdf`.
