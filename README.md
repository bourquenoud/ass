# Assembly Syntax Synthesiser

This tool can generate an assembler in C based on simple opcode and mnemonics descriptions.

# Getting started

***DISCLAIMER*** *: It has only been tested on Linux. As it requires POSIX and GNU libraries it probably won't compile for MacOS, and certainly won't for Windows. However, the generated code is portable across all three OSs.*

## Build and install

***INFO*** *: The following commands assume you are working in your home directory on a Debian ditribution.*

Install the dependencies first, using `apt` or your prefered package manager.

```bash
sudo apt install bison flex gcc make git xxd
```

Clone the repository.
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/elzaidir/ass.git
```

Build `ass` with make.

```bash
cd ~/ass
make
```

You can also install it, but it is not required.

```bash
cd ~/ass
sudo make install
```

## Building a basic assembler

***INFO*** *: The following commands assume you have installed `ass`.*

Once `ass` has been built you can generate an assembler C project from an example. Create a directory for your assembler project, this will contain the source file of the generated assembler. We then call `ass`.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir myfirstassembler
ass -o myfirstassembler/basic_assembler.c ass/examples/basic_assembler.ass
```

We can then compile the generated file. It only requires the standard libraries.

Here we use `gcc` but you can use any standard compliant C compiler.

```bash
cd ~/myfirstassembler/
gcc -o basic_assembler basic_assembler.c
```

If everything went well, you now have a `basic_assembler` executable in your project directory.

## Using the assembler

***INFO*** *: The generated assemblers can currently only output [Intel HEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX) files. More format will be added in the near future. For now you can use a converter from HEX to the format you want.*

To compile an assembler file using our newly built assembler use :

```bash
cd ~/myfirstassembler
./basic_assembler -o output.hex ../ass/examples/basic_assembler.asm
```
